# DS-200
In this DS:200 module 4 we have to download various datasets from <a href="https://data.gov.in">data.gov.in</a>. Then plot a): bar plot, b): scatter plot, and c): box plot. And list down our observations.
All required plot figures, python script (.ipynb) file and datasets are in "DS:200_plots_data.zip"
<h3> Bar Plot</h3>
For the bar plot we have used " State-UT-wise Funds Allocated, Released and Utilized under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin from 2016-17 to 2018-19 " dataset.
Figure " BarPlot.png" shows the corresponding bar plot, plotted between Funds Utilized under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin for 2016-17 and 2017-18, and different states.
<h4>Observations:</h4>
<li>For 2016-17, among all the states Madhya Pradesh has hisgest utilization rate. During the same period some states have negligible utilization rate may due to initial phase of the scheme.
AS, people may not be aware about the benefits of the scheme. </li>
<li>For 2017-18, there is significant rise in utilization rate from almost all the states. During the same period Uttar Pradesh has highest utilization rate.
</li>
<hr>
<h3> Scatter Plot</h3>
For the scatter plot we have used " total-number-and-amount-money-orders-india-during-2000-01-2010-11 " dataset.
Figure " ScatterPlot.png" shows the corresponding scatter plot, plotted between year and number of money orders issued in India.
<h4>Observations:</h4>
<li>With the advancement in internet and mobile phones, the popularity of moneyorders keep on decreasing, as people prefer to use internet banking over money orders.
This trend can be depicted from the plot as well, with the increase in year the number of money orders decreases.
</li>
<hr>
<h3> Box Plot</h3>
For the box plot we have used " water-quality-tributary-streams-panchganga-and-bhima-2014 " dataset.
Figure " BoxPlot.png" shows the corresponding box plot, plotted between states and min range pH value in range 6.5-8.5.
<h4>Observations:</h4>
<li>
We can observe from the plot that Maharashtra has lower pH range ( near to neutral) than that of Karnataka. 
</li>
<li>Maximum pH range for Maharashtra lies below the minimum pH value of Karnataka. Also the median lies closer to neural pH for Maharashtra.</li>
<li>We can observe some outliers around box plot of Karnataka, depicting that some water bodies in Karnataka has lower pH value.</li>
